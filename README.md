# Boomber-reactgame

This is very basic react js app to impove my skills and challange myself. 

So you can use it as first app to understand basics of React Js. 

React js is used as library and connected as regular JS library. 

All my knowledge was up to Keys topic from "tutorialspoint.com". https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/index.htm

So enjoy, have fun and try to win the Boomber Game! lol :)
